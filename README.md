### What I learned

````css
Learned how to set relative font-familys using the @font-face rule. For example, font-family: ; src: url was something unfamilar to me. I found
that adding a relative pathway was more straightforward then directly linking to google's font library.

I studied up more on the box model, which helped me manipulate display: flex containers more easily, I did not understand that some element properties need to
be set before they will show with flexbox. I also learned how to set box-sizing: border-box; to the whole html docuement, which made sizing block elements much easier.

```devtools
Need to use this more, helped fine tune some difficulties I was having.

### Continued development

I need to continue working on my understanding of flexbox and the box model. I understand some of the basics but I still have difficulty arranging items next to each other, especially getting thier dimensions to match. I need to learn more about percentatges as well, which I have read help with responsive layouts.
